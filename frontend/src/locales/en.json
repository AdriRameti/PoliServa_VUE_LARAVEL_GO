    "SUB_1": "Poliserva is an experience platform for web API developers.",
    "SUB_2": "Our mission is to make developers productive through automatic code generation.",
    "POLISERVA_NECESSITY": "Our Necessity",
    "ABOUT_P1": "Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have taken the world by storm and are now the de facto standard for software communication. Almost all software products today consume APIs. The business model of many companies around the world is based on the consumption of their APIs. API providers therefore strive to increase API adoption rates by spending millions of dollars each year to improve the developer experience. This is typically done by providing software development kits (SDKs) and API documentation to the developer who consumes your APIs. However, developing SDKs and writing documentation are time-consuming, monotonous, and error-prone tasks. It is a slow process and costs a lot of time and money.",
    "OUR_TECHNOLOGIES": "Our Technologies",
    "ABOUT_P2": "Our code generation engine enables API providers to generate SDKs for their APIs in minutes and for a fraction of the cost. We provide tools like our API Editor and API Transformer to further help API providers minimize the time it takes to ship high-quality SDKs to developers using their APIs. Our code generation engine is also capable of generating succinct, error-free documentation for both APIs and SDKs. SDK documentation includes dynamic screenshots detailing usage instructions tailored to the vendor-specific API, as well as code snippets showing usage examples. As icing on the cake, we provide beautifully designed DX portals to encapsulate this documentation.",
    "ABOUT_P3": "While doing research work for their final papers for the IES L'Estaci√≥ institute in 2022, our founders came across one of the weak points of online track reservations: the responsiveness of the page and the difficulty of user interaction. They realized that the administrators of the reservation web pages did not take care of the treatment with the client, causing them to add negative ratings to the page.",
    "ABOUT_P4": "It was so clear that, although the administrators knew that there were bad evaluations, they were not going to improve the application that we got down to work to start the development of the application and be able to present it as a future project to the Ontinyent city council.",
    "PROGRESS": "Progress",
    "ABOUT_P5": "Poliserva has come a short way since its creation . But this does not prevent the project from growing with new and strong values which are:",
    "LIST_1": "Caring for the environment, caring for our future",
    "LIST_2": "Transparency with the client",
    "LIST_3": "Grow as a person and with the team",
